# Sign-Language-Recognition-using-CNN-and-GCN
Sign language recognition plays a crucial role in bridging communication barriers between the deaf or hard of hearing individuals and the hearing community. Here, we offer a comprehensive study on sign language recognition, focusing on the development and evaluation of effective algorithms and systems for automatic interpretation of sign language gestures. Two different datasets of sign language are analysed and utilised for training and evaluation. We’ve built each model for each dataset. We’ve performed classical machine learning techniques on one dataset whereas used CNN on the other one. There are some potential applications of sign language recognition in areas such as assistive technologies, education, and human-computer interaction.
